I am a Master's student at the School Of Computing, University Of Utah. My research interests are in data center storage and Distributed Systems.
I'm passionate about building storage systems that leverage newer network fabrics such as Infiniband/RDMA. My current research focuses on re-evaluating design decisions for In-Memory Databases in the context of modern hardware.
I interned with Linkedin in the summer of 2016 in their Mountain View Campus. I was working for the Monitoring Infrastructure team developing auto remediation solutions for the infrastructure. I developed an out of band monitoring solution and some state driven automation.


# <a name="advisors"></a> Advisors
- [Prof. Ryan Stutsman](http://rstutsman.github.io/), who built phenomenal systems
such as [RAMCloud](http://ramcloud.stanford.edu/) and [Deuteronomy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/high-performance-transactions-in-deuteronomy/)
- [Prof. Robert Ricci](http://www.flux.utah.edu/users/ricci/), who is credited with some of the best known network research test beds such as [APT](https://www.aptlab.net/), [Cloudlab](https://www.cloudlab.us) and [Emulab](http://emulab.net/).

# <a name="workex"></a> Experience
I am working as a Research Assistant under Prof. Stutsman.
