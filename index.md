*I defended my master's thesis on February 23rd, 2017. The [Thesis](https://github.com/anirajk/masters-thesis) and 
[Code](https://github.com/anirajk/ibv-bench/tree/ddio) are available on github.*

I am a Master's student at the School Of Computing, University Of Utah. My research interests are in data center storage and Distributed Systems and how modern NICs impact performance of scalable In-Memory Stores.
I'm passionate about building storage systems that leverage newer network fabrics such as Infiniband/RDMA
I interned with Linkedin in the summer of 2016 in their Mountain View Campus. I was working for the Monitoring Infrastructure team developing auto remediation solutions for their stack. I developed an out of band monitoring solution in python and some state driven automation using saltstack.


# <a name="advisors"></a> Advisors
- I was advised by [Prof. Ryan Stutsman](http://rstutsman.github.io/), who built phenomenal systems
such as [RAMCloud](http://ramcloud.stanford.edu/) and [Deuteronomy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/high-performance-transactions-in-deuteronomy/)
- I have also worked with [Prof. Robert Ricci](http://www.flux.utah.edu/users/ricci/), who is credited with some of the best known network research test beds such as [APT](https://www.aptlab.net/), [Cloudlab](https://www.cloudlab.us) and [Emulab](http://emulab.net/).

# <a name="workex"></a> Experience
I am working as a Research Assistant under Prof. Stutsman with the Utah Scalable Computer Systems group.
Earlier I was a Research Assistant in the [Flux Research Group](https://www.flux.utah.edu/) under Prof. Ricci.<br>
In the summer of 2016, I interned with LinkedIn.
Formerly, I was as an R&D Engineer at DreamWorks Animation ([IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6593212/))
and before that I was working with Zynga in their ZCloud Storage Research team on [zBase](https://zynga.com/blogs/engineering/zbase-high-performance-elastic-distributed-key-value-store-2).<br>
I graduated with a bachelor's degree from [Govt. Model Engineering College](http://www.mec.ac.in/) in 2012.
